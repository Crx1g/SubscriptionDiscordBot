# SubscriptionDiscordBot
A discord bot for giving a role for a certain amount of time.


Simple discord bot written in JS to give out a role for a certain amount of time. 
Currently, you can give out 7 days, 1 month, 1 year. Will update it to give any amount of time you want soon.

All you need change in it is the token and the ID of the discord role. 

Command: !subscribe @user 7d (Will give the user tagged 7 days of the role).

If the bot is stopped, it will lose track of the time so if you want you can back it up into a DB that the bot will read off of.
